Have you ever been hungry but didn't know what you wanted to eat?

Have you ever been inspired by beautiful photography?

hungry + photographic inspiration =  Appetizing!

## What is Appetizing

Appetizing is a stream of category=food photography from the UnSplash API.  

The user is hungry and undecided. As they scroll through the beautiful hi-res photos, their visual senses will engage to help them make a decision on what to eat.

Once they have decided, they can click on a photo and it will generate a Yelp list of restaurants near them that serve that type of food.

## Planning

#### Phase 1

- [x] Test UnSplash API in browser. Return Json.
- [ ] Create UnSplashService class and return LogCat response.
- [ ] Create Recycler View for UnSplash on main
- [ ] Create Button on View Item To Search local
- [ ] Button intent moves to RestaurantActivity
- [ ] Style Content
